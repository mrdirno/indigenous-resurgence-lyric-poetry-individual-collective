### Story Entry Points

- Write a poem from the perspective of the river, addressing Keeley. What does it remember that she has forgotten?
- Compose a letter from Keeley's mother, Brenda Miller, justifying her choice to assimilate, using the language of 'surfaces' (practicality, security, progress).
- Create a short story about a day in the life of Aunt Doreen twenty years prior, showing how she learned to 'read the land.'
- Write the transcript of a Band Council meeting where the dam proposal is debated, capturing the tension between economic need and cultural survival.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Parcel 0472-B, layering geological survey data with Indigenous place names, plant lore, and animal migration paths mentioned in the text.
- Develop a 'Language Reclamation' text tool that visually shows the erosion of an Indigenous sentence as colonial words replace original terms, mirroring the novel's theme of 'deleting words.'
